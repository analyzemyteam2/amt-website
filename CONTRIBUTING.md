📋 Development Guidelines
Code Standards
JavaScript Standards
javascript// ✅ Good: Triangle Defense naming conventions
function analyzeFormation(offensiveAlignment) {
  const clsData = {
    configuration: getConfiguration(offensiveAlignment),
    location: getFieldLocation(offensiveAlignment),
    situation: getCurrentSituation()
  };
  
  return calculateTriangleDefenseResponse(clsData);
}

// ❌ Avoid: Vague or non-descriptive names
function doStuff(data) {
  return processData(data);
}
CSS Standards
css/* ✅ Good: BEM methodology with Triangle Defense context */
.triangle-defense__formation {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "safety safety safety"
    "corner linebacker corner";
}

.triangle-defense__formation--boundary-coverage {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
}

/* ❌ Avoid: Generic or unclear class names */
.box {
  display: flex;
}
HTML Standards
html<!-- ✅ Good: Semantic HTML with accessibility -->
<section class="triangle-defense" aria-labelledby="triangle-defense-title">
  <h2 id="triangle-defense-title">5-3-1 Triangle Defense System</h2>
  <div class="formation-diagram" role="img" aria-label="Triangle Defense formation showing safety, corner, and linebacker positioning">
    <!-- Formation content -->
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ❌ Avoid: Non-semantic markup without accessibility -->
<div class="section">
  <div class="title">Some Title</div>
  <div class="content">
    <!-- Content without context -->
  </div>
</div>
Performance Requirements
Core Web Vitals Targets

Optimization Guidelines

Images: WebP format with fallbacks, lazy loading
CSS: Critical CSS inlined, non-critical CSS deferred
JavaScript: ES6+ with Babel transpilation, code splitting
Fonts: Font-display: swap, preload critical fonts

Triangle Defense Specific Guidelines
Methodology References
When referencing Triangle Defense concepts, use official terminology:
javascript// ✅ Correct Triangle Defense terminology
const FORMATION_TYPES = {
  LARRY: 'larry',      // Trips + TE
  LINDA: 'linda',      // Trips + Back
  RITA: 'rita',        // Twins + TE + Back
  RICKY: 'ricky',      // 2x2 + Back
  LEON: 'leon',        // Bunch + Back
  RANDY: 'randy',      // Stack + Back
  PAT: 'pat'           // Empty/4 Verticals
};

const CLS_FRAMEWORK = {
  CONFIGURATION: 'formation_alignment',
  LOCATION: 'field_position',
  SITUATION: 'down_distance_context'
};
Data Classification
Respect the Triangle Defense intellectual property hierarchy:
javascript// Public - Educational content
const publicFormationTypes = getPublicFormations();

// Proprietary - Triangle Defense methodology (handle with care)
const proprietaryAnalysis = getTriangleDefenseAlgorithm(); // Requires special handling

// Confidential - Client-specific data (strict access control)
const clientData = getCoachingIntelligence(); // Requires authentication
